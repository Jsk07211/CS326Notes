Shell usually starts at 1

bin - directory with all the binary code, but xv6 doesn't have one :3

echo $PATH shows you all the bins, sbins are usually binary that uses the superuser's root

!! - run last command

Comments are included in the history (full form of the command)

if 4 processes (for pipes), have child run the last program so everything has to wait for that child
