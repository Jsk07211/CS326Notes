# CPU Scheduling

## Context Switching
  - Process Control Block (process struct in xv6)

## Interrupts for Context Switching (Preemptive Scheduling)
## Cooperative Multitasking (What is it, what are its weaknesses)

## Scheduling Quantum
## I/O while scheduling (disk, network, etc)

# Scheduling Algorithms
## Scheduling Metrics
## Basic Scheduling Algorithms
### FIFO
### SJC
### STJF
### STCF
### Round Robin (RR)
### Lottery
### Priority

## Scheduling with I/O
- When we do I/O, we are blocking

## Multi-Level Feedback Queues (MLFQ)
### What a regular MLQ looks like
### How do we prioritise tasks? Do we know how long they will run ahead of time? Do we know their resource requirements?
### What is MLFQ designed for?
### What are its main goals?
### Actual steps of MLFQ
### Nice level
### Starvation and Fork Bombing

- Know what they do
- Know their strengths and weaknesses
