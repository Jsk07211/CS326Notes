/*
in the past:
software on floppy disk used to be written for the hardware and support booting up yourself

without OS, you won't have:
1. multitasking
2. hardware drivers
3. file systems

OS abstracts the underlying hardware and exposes a clean, easy-to-use interface to software applications

System call:
channel used to communicate

CPU scheduling:
how stuff gets to run when multitasking

quizzes:
handwritten notes allowed

sometimes quiz questions are revealed in advance :D

late submission policy:
- must have at least some parts of the project done before you get a week's grace 

quizzes on MONDAY, things due on MONDAY

Introduction to Operating Systems
- Using VMs (hosted on gojira)
