"Secondary storage" is good because it doesn't lose everything when the power goes out
"Primary storage" is RAM

Disks are:
1. Bigger
2. CHeaper
3. Slower

** Disks are massively slower than everything else (both SSDs and HDDs)

File system: How things get laid out on the disk (how we store data on it)
- More advanced than simple linked list since we need to index quickly


# Inodes
- Way to to store metadata, but not their names
- dir entries hold file names

- ln(): link lets us link multiple file names to the same underlying file data

Directories have a link count of two because of: . (current directory) and .. (previous directory)

Files get deleted via 'unlink', and they are removed once their link count hits 
- When link_count == 0, they can now be overwritten

# Superblocks
- Disks suffer from fragmentation (just like memory)
- Superblocks store main FS (file system) information (Don't lose the superblock)
  - Maybe have superblock backup?

sd* are the hard disks on gojira
- If we want to destroy the hard disks, just fill enough zeroes to clear the superblock

Making a disk:
bs = 1M: block size = 1 MB
count = 1000: How many of these blocks we want

# Permissions
- Know how permissions work for both single and multi-user systems
- Basic permissions: rwx, sticky bits, setuid bit, file type

** How permissions work for directories is important!

Octal permissions:
chgrp (change group)
chown (change ownership)
chmod (change mode)

HDDs
Rotational delay, seek time, which part is faster to read/write

# Scheduling
- Know everything in detail except CFQ algorithm 

Reading/Writing SSDs
