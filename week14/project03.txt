Linked List
Header: How big they are; Are they free?

Block list is not common in a memory allocator, but it makes debugging easier and we can print out memory alloc

Use bitwise arithmetic to store the free status in the block->size

Create functions to manipulate linked lists

void add_free(struct mem_block *block) {
	if (free_list_head == NULL) {
		free_list_head = block;
		free_list_tail = block;
	} else {
		free_list_tail->next_block = block;
		block->prev_block = free_list_tail;
		free_list_tail = block;
	}
}
