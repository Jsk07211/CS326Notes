Concurrency - running different things at the same time
Parallelism - running multiple copies of the same thing at once
	- they can share data with other (although we do want to minimise stuff because it goes funny?)

buffer in memory that temporarily stores the pipe

Before they used file descriptors, you'd call open on a filename, but how do you represent that you open that file?
	- they would keep saying they would read from that file, but the problem is they were hardcoded to the path

	i_node - a chunk of data that says fd points at this chunk of data
		- size decided when designing the file system

	context switching - we only save the register, the cache is more hardware (so we don't really)
		- on windows, can pin process to a core to prevent it from moving around

high performance computing looks at how to take a program and makes compiler optimise for cache hits
- but you have to know something about the hardware for that

interrupt supported by the hardware, trap table that says what to do when what happens, signal interrupt is function pointer to code to execute when this signal is received
