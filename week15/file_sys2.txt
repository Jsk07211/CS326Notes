# File Permissions
- Basic: Each file has an owner and a group

Basic Permissions can be applied to:
- The user
- The group
- Everyone else

By default, if executable, treated like a file script

# Permissions
## READ

## WRITE

## EXECUTE
1. Files 
2. Directories: Can enter the directory (not necessarily read it though!)
   - May be in quiz!!

chmod:
rwx = 111 (7)
rw- = 110 (6)
r-- = 100 (4)
-w- = 010 (2)
  - You can echo into the file, but you can't read it!

** But root can always do whatever it wants!!

chmod o-w project04.txt : o for others, other people cannot write to file

ugo+x (everyone gets x!) == +x

rm permission is based on directory permissions!

Can't give files to other people in UNIX

bash protection for setuid shell
